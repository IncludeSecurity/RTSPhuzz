# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We're not planning on making major releases of this software, just incremental updates to master. So current master is always suggested if there end up being any security vulns we'll let you know is this file.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vuln in this software, please create an issue in github. We should get back to you in a timely manner and PRs to fix any found vulns are VERY much appreciated.
